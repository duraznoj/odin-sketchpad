# odin-sketchpad

Project to create an interactive, web-based sketchpad using the following methods:

- Use of CSS grid and flexbox to create sketchpad layout;
- Implementation of slider element within pop-up modal to enable user to specify desired grid resolution;
- Manipulation of DOM to dynamically generate, edit, and refresh sketchpad grid based on user input; and
- Utilization of cross-device compatible pointer event listeners to enable user to color sketchpad pixels.
- Use of radio buttons to allow user to choose between draw and erase tools, as well as to provide random RGB color and incremental opacity drawing options.
