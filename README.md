# odin-sketchpad

Project to create an interactive, web-based sketchpad using the following methods:

-> Use of CSS grid and flexbox to create sketchpad layout;
-> Implementation of slider element within pop-up modal to enable user to specify desired grid resolution;
-> Manipulation of DOM to dynamically generate, edit, and refresh sketchpad grid based on user input; and
-> Utilization of cross-device compatible pointer event listeners to enable user to color sketchpad pixels.
